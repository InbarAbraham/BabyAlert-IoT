# ðŸ‘¶ Baby Alert Detection System

A Raspberry Piâ€“powered real-time monitoring system that detects the presence of a baby in a locked car using an AI-powered camera model. If a baby is detected, the system sends an instant alert via Telegram.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- **Goal**: Prevent life-threatening scenarios by alerting parents if a baby is detected in a locked car.
- **Technology**: Raspberry Pi, USB camera, YOLOv11 model, Telegram Bot integration.
- **Detection Flow**:
  1. Lamp ON = car is unlocked.
  2. Once the lock button is pressed, the system activates the camera and model.
  3. If a baby is detected, a Telegram alert is sent to the parent.

## ðŸ’» Software Stack

- **Python** â€“ programming language used throughout the project.
- **OpenCV** â€“ handles video streaming and frame processing.
- **PyTorch + YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)** â€“ for object detection.
- **RPi.GPIO** â€“ controls the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
- **Label Studio** â€“ used for annotating training images.
- **Telegram Bot API** â€“ used to send alerts when a baby is detected.

## ðŸ§ª Custom Model Training Process

###  Collect and Label Data & Train the Detection Model
- We collected 500 images of babies from various sources.
- Training is handled via [`Train_YOLO_Models.ipynb`](Train_YOLO_Models.ipynb).
- YOLOv11 from Ultralytics was trained on our custom dataset.
- The trained model is exported and moved to the Raspberry Pi for deployment.

## ðŸ“² Telegram Bot Integration
- Telegram bot created with **BotFather**.  
- Alerts sent via **Telegram Bot API** using Python.
